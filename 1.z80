; Assume the 74C923 is connected to Z80 as follows:
; - 74C923 data output (pin 13, DA) is connected to a Z80 input port (e.g., IN A, (PORT_NUMBER))
; - NMI generator is connected to Z80's NMI input (pin 11, NMI)

ORG 0000h ; Start address of your program

; Define constants
PORT_NUMBER EQU 10h ; Replace with the actual port number where 74C923 is connected
NMI_VECTOR EQU 0066h ; Address where the NMI handler routine will be located

; Initialize
    DI          ; Disable interrupts during initialization
    LD A, 00100000b ; Set up interrupt control register (IM 0, NMI enabled)
    OUT (0FFh), A   ; Write to I/O port for interrupt control (change if needed)
    IM 0        ; Set interrupt mode to mode 0
    
; Assume you will place the NMI handler's address into the NMI vector.
    LD HL, NMI_Handler ; Load the NMI handler address
    LD (NMI_VECTOR), HL ; Store it in the NMI vector location
    
; Your main program goes here
    ; [Your main code]

; NMI Handler Routine
NMI_Handler:
    PUSH AF     ; Save registers
    PUSH BC
    PUSH DE
    PUSH HL

; Read data from 74C923
    IN A, (PORT_NUMBER) ; Read the data from the 74C923 into register A

; Process the key press data (A) as needed
    ; [Your code here to process and store the key press data]

; End of NMI routine
